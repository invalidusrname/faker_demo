== Faker Demo

A sample rails application using faker for populating data.

== Instructions

# install faker from rubygems
# run migrations
# run faker task

http://faker.rubyforge.org/

You can also import larger data sets using the ar-extensions gem.
An example can be found in the faker_extension:user task. Although
it is faster, the downfall with this approach is that it doesn't 
work with associations.
